# 🏨 — Hotel Booking Cancellation Analysis  

✨ My second data analytics project, focused on exploring hotel booking cancellations, identifying patterns, and sharing insights to help reduce cancellations and improve business decisions 🚀  

---

## 📌 Project Overview  

This project was part of my **data analytics learning journey**.  
I worked with hotel booking data using both **Excel** and **Power BI** to practice end-to-end analysis:  

- 🧹 Cleaning & transforming raw data (Excel & Power Query)  
- 🔗 Building data models and relationships  
- 🎨 Designing dashboards in Power BI  
- 💡 Extracting insights on booking behavior & cancellations

## 🔍 Key Business Questions  

1️⃣ What percentage of bookings get **cancelled**?  
2️⃣ Do cancellations vary by **hotel type, season, or country**?  
3️⃣ How do **lead time** and **deposit type** impact cancellations?  
4️⃣ Are there noticeable **monthly/seasonal trends**?  
5️⃣ What recommendations can help hotels **reduce cancellations**?
